## How to Print and Export a Report in the  ASP.NET Core Application without the Document Viewer

This example prints and exports a report in a browser without previewing it on a web page with a Document Viewer.

**Print**

On the **server side**, a controller performs the following actions:
- creates a report
- exports the report to PDF
- sends the PDF file back to the client.

On the **client-side**, a user can do one of the following:

* Print a report in a new tab.
Click a button to call the client-side `window.Open(url, "_blank")` method to open a new window that contains a PDF file and print the window content.

* Print a report in iFrame. 
Click a button to load a PDF file in the `HTMLIFrameElement` and print its content.

**Export**

The user selects the format and clicks a button to send the format to the server-side controller. The controller calls the export method for the selected format and sends the file back to the browser.
